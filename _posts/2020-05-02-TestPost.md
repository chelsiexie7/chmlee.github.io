<script src="/js/hide-toggle.js"></script>

# title

This is a post to test the hide functionality.

<div class="hide-wrapper">
    <button onclick="hide('item1')">Button 1</button>

    <div id="item1">
        Press "Button 1" to hide this line.
    </div>
</div>

You are not able to hide this line

<div class="hide-wrapper">
    <button onclick="hide('item2')">Button 2</button>

    <div id="item2">
        Press "Button 2" to hide this line.
    </div>
</div>

You don't necessarily need a button element; "onclick" works on almost all elements.

<div class="hide-wrapper">
    <p>Press <em onclick="hide('item3')">HIDE</em> to hide the next sentence</p>

    <div id="item3">
        Something something blablabla
    </div>
</div>


<!-- You should not be reading anything below this line in markdown -->

If you download the raw markdown file, you'll notice two non-markdown syntax:

```html
<script src="/js/hide-toggle.js"></script>
```

and

```html
<div class="hide-wrapper">
    <button onclick="hide('item1')">Button 1</button>

    <div id="item1">
        Press "Button 1" to hide this line.
    </div>
</div>
```

The first line of code loads the javascript file that make hiding element possible.
Copy [this javascript file](https://github.com/chmlee/chmlee.github.io/blob/master/js/hide-toggle.js) to [the `js` folder in your repository](https://github.com/chelsiexie7/chelsiexie7.github.io/tree/master/js)

The second line of code is self-explanatory.
Three things to note:
1. You don't necessarily need `class='hide-wrapper'`, but if you want to further customized your post with css, be careful at what you name your class attribute.
2. The `id` attribute in `div` has to match that variable in `hide` function. In this case, to hide `<div id="item1"></div>`, we need a button with `<button onclick="hide('item1')">Button 1</button>`
3. `id` attribute in each `div` has to be unique. We've used `item1` as the `id` for the example, so we should never use this `item1` for other `div`
